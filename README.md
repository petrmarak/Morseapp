# Graphical User Interface for Morse Application
This my first application with GUI, created using Windows Forms in .NET 5 for learning purposes.

Since I'm still new to programming, any help and tips for improving my code or suggestions about new useful features that could be added to it are very much appreciated.

### Planned updates
- Modify the Update tool to determine type of release build (.NET dependent vs Standalone) by program's file size instead of name.
- Make textboxes multiline to better utilize vertical space.
- When changing language, apply the new language immediately and do not require restart.
#### Nice to have things:
- Try modify MorsePlayer() to run in a new thread without freezing GUI.
- Make the main form resizable with all GUI controls correctly adapting to the new form size (textBoxes changing its vertical and horizontal length).
- Write unit tests.
